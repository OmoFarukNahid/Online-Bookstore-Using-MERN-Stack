# ðŸ“š Online Bookstore (MERN Stack)

This repository contains the source code for an Online Bookstore built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). 
The project is organized into two main folders: **Frontend** and **Backend**. The Frontend contains the React application for the user interface, while the Backend contains the Node.js and Express server that connects to MongoDB and serves API requests. 


After downloading or cloning this repository, unzip the files if necessary and open the project in Visual Studio Code or your preferred editor. 
To install the required dependencies, open a terminal and navigate to the **Frontend** folder by using `cd Frontend` and run `npm install`, 
then navigate to the **Backend** folder by using `cd Backend` and run `npm install` again. 
This step recreates the `node_modules` folders locally based on the `package.json` files and ensures all dependencies are installed correctly. 
Without this step the project will not run, because `node_modules` folders are not included in this repository.

Once dependencies are installed, you can run both parts of the project locally. 
To start the Frontend, open a terminal, go to the **Frontend** folder and run `npm run dev`. 
This will launch the React development server, usually available at `http://localhost:5173` or a similar port depending on your setup. 

To start the Backend, open another terminal, go to the **Backend** folder and run `npm start`. 
This will start the Node.js server, usually available at `http://localhost:5000` or whatever port you configure. 
You may need to modify a `.env` file inside the **Backend** folder to define your MongoDB connection string, port number, cloudinary or any other environment variables required by the application.

In short, the steps to run the project are: unzip or clone the repository, open it in VS Code, run `npm install` in both **Frontend** and **Backend**, 
then run `npm run dev` in **Frontend** and `npm start` in **Backend** in separate terminals. 
This will set up the full MERN stack bookstore application on your local machine.

This repository does not include `node_modules` because they are automatically generated by `npm install`.
